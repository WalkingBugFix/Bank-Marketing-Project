The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y). For this, we will perform all the necessary steps such as data exploration, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and selection, model building, performance evaluation, and final predictions.
